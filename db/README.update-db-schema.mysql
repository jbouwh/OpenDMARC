To update your database to the current state use this script like this:

  mysql -u <user> -p <passwd> --force < update-db-schema.mysql

You might receive up to four errors about duplicate keys - this is expected if your database
already has these keys (because you used the MySQL schema in the db sub-direcory instead of
the obsolete schema in the reports sub-dirctory).
